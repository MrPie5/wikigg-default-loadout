## How to use this script

1. Either use git to clone this repo or copy-paste the contents of `main.py` to a local directory.
2. Install the latest version of [mwcleric](https://github.com/RheingoldRiver/mwcleric)
3. Set up a bot password for wiki.gg. Give it basic rights, editing pages, editing protected pages, changing protection levels of pages, moving pages, and editing system messages.
    * Note, usually you don't want to give passwords both edit system messages & high-volume editing, so try and use a unique password for just this one script.
4. Set the target to the wiki you want (by default, `gg.wiki.gg`, the testing wiki
5. Set `use_site_pw` to `True` if you are editing an onboarding wiki (but you may want to test that it's working on gg.wiki.gg first)
6. Run the script.
